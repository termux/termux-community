### 1. Follow posting guidelines

Check the [How to ask, report and request](how-to-ask-report-and-request.md) docs for rules to follow when posting.

## &nbsp;

&nbsp;



### 2. Only English

Our communities are international and English is a universal language in the technology and programming sphere, which makes easier to read posts and follow conversations.

If you have poor knowledge of English, you can use translation services provided by Google or other providers.

We will delete non-English posts.

### 3. No hacking

Termux official communities neither provide support nor allow others to post or comment about hacking ([blackhat](hacking.md#blackhat-hacking-not-allowed), [whitehat](hacking.md#whitehat-hacking-not-allowed) or any other colour) or [hacking packages](hacking.md#hacking-packages-not-allowed), other than some [exceptions](hacking.md#exceptions). Related topics like [spamming](hacking.md#spamming-not-allowed), [DOS/DDOS](hacking.md#dos-and-ddos-not-allowed), [OSINT](hacking.md#osint-not-allowed) are not allowed either. Asking and posting more than once is one of the fastest paths to a ban. Check our [hacking](hacking.md) rules for more info.

Posts violating this rule will be deleted. Users violating this rule may receive a permanent ban.

&nbsp;



### 4. No toxic behavior, trolling or spamming

Being deliberately offensive or disrespectful to specific persons, Termux maintainers or the whole community, as well as any behavior aimed at disrupting conversations, is not tolerated.

Posts violating this rule will be deleted. Users violating this rule may receive a temporary or permanent ban.

## &nbsp;

&nbsp;



### 5. No Non-Termux content

We are not the *world information bureau*. Our communities are solely about Termux, its use cases, usage experience and content produced by community members.

Little off-topic is okay, but abuse of our community for gathering knowledge about custom ROMs, custom kernels, Android OS, networking, programming, general computer science and basics is strongly discouraged. If you are looking for help with a topic that is not directly related to the Termux project, including general usage or problems of specific packages, please consider looking into more suitable communities and Internet resources.

You should not post any kind of information that discourages use of Termux application and its packages in the context of advertising own or third-party "better" utility.

Posts violating this rule will be deleted. Users violating this rule with inappropriate content (nsfw, gambling, lotteries, etc) will receive a permanent ban.

## &nbsp;

&nbsp;



### 6. Reasonable Content Quality

We expect that all posted content is true and has reasonable quality. Poor quality or unsafe content that may put our users at risk will be deleted.

It is strongly suggested to be familiar with Termux before giving advises to our users. Do not copy-paste commands from third party Internet resources without understanding their meaning. If you use ChatGPT or other AI system for writing assistance, make sure you fully understand the topic and have verified the generated content.

Posts violating this rule will be deleted. Users violating this rule may receive a temporary or permanent ban.

## &nbsp;

&nbsp;



### 7. No useless or spam posts, issues pull requests

Such postings wastes the time of maintainers and pollutes the communities. If you are opening a pull request to improve your GitHub stats, consider sending useful pull requests that actually solves an issue, or ask what to work on by opening a discussion first. Moreover, GitHub does not allow deleting pull requests and one does not create pull requests accidentally, it takes a lot of clicks and effort, so if you do create spam pull requests in our repos, expect to get a temporary or even a permanent ban on repeat offense.

Posts violating this rule will be deleted. Users violating this rule may receive a temporary or permanent ban.

&nbsp;



### 8. Avoid direct messages to Termux maintainers

Please use [our official communities](../index.md#official-communities) to ask questions about Termux so that others with similar queries can benefit too.

Do not ask Termux maintainers for every single question about Termux, especially when it comes about utility usage or how to get started. We have community pages on various social media sites where you can ask your questions or share some Termux-related content. Specific technical questions may only be asked privately if really necessary.
